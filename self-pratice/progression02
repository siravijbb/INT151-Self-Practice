this week we learn in keys in obj, obj in ref (pointer) to memory location
in obj, there will "keys" and value assosatate others
value can contain array or value  which array can contain key called nested key
in shallowequality we compare lenght and each key to have same

//
to compare obj, ajarn said we can convert to json then chck as well as it would be text compare text
however it would be overhead due to convert to text to check but in small number

//
Tool used; github co pilot for debuging but entire code was written by me
